                    A computer programmer, or coder, is someone who writes computer software. The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist
                    in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.One who practices or professes
                    a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. The term programmer can be used to refer to a software developer,
                    software engineer, computer scientist, or software analyst. However, members of these professions typically possess other software engineering
                    skills beyond programming. For this reason, the term programmer is sometimes considered an oversimplification of these other professions.
                    This has sparked much debate amongst developers, analysts, computer scientists, programmers, and outsiders who continue to be
                    puzzled at the subtle differences in these occupations. Within software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded
                    as one phase in a software developmental process.

                    There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an art,
                    a craft or an engineering discipline. In general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three,
                    with the goal of producing an efficient software solution.

                    The discipline differs from many other technical professions in that a programmer, in general, does not need to be licensed
                    or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to call themselves a "programmer" or even a "software engineer."

                    However, representing oneself as a "professional software engineer" without a license from
                    an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world. Because the discipline covers
                    many areas, which may or may not include critical applications, it is debatable whether licensing
                    is required for the profession as a whole. In most cases, the discipline is self-governed by the entities which require the programming.

                    A computer programmer figures out the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting
                    and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in a programming language
                    so the computer can 'understand' it. The code may be a modification of an existing source or something completely new.

                    Some, especially those working on large projects that involve many programmers, use computer-assisted software
                    engineering (CASE) tools to automate much of the coding process. These tools enable a programmer to concentrate
                    on writing the unique parts of a program. A programmer working on smaller projects will often use “programmer
                    environments,” applications that increase productivity by combining compiling, code walk-through, code generation,
                    test data generation, and debugging functions. A programmer will also use libraries of basic code that can be modified
                    or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases
                    programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps. The programmer will also be responsible for maintaining the program’s health.
