                <p class="card-text text-lead text-primary text-capitalize">Linux or GNU/Linux is a free and open source software Unix-like operating system for computers.
                    An operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that manage the electronic parts of the computer
                    allowing running application programs. Linux is Free and open source software (FOSS). Free and open source software
                    (FOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, change it or share it.</p>

                            There is a lot of software for Linux and—like Linux itself—a lot of the software for Linux is free software.
                            This means that it doesn't put any license restrictions on users. This is one reason why many people like to use Linux.
                            The defining component of Linux is the Linux kernel.Linux was originally developed as a free operating system
                            for personal computers. Thanks to its dominance on smartphones, Android, which is built on top of the Linux kernel, has
                            the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.Linux, in its original form, is also the leading
                            operating system on servers such as mainframe computers and supercomputers,but is used on only around 1.5% of desktop
                            computers.[10] Linux also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose operating system is typically built into the
                            firmware and is highly tailored to the system; this includes mobile phones ,tablet computers, network routers,
                            facility automation controls, televisions,video game consoles and smartwatches.

                    new versions of Windows go on sale every three years. The newest version, Windows 10, came out
                    July 29, 2015. Most newly bought personal computers come with Windows 10, although some older or
                    cheaper ones may have older versions such as Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 installed. Until July 29, 2016,
                    they can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free.</p>

                            Many kinds of applications/programs are available for Windows. Some popular applications are games,
                            word processors (to write words) or additional programs like Adobe Flash Player (to watch some videos and play many games on internet sites).
                            Adding new applications to Windows is called "installing". Applications can be bought/purchased on a CD or DVD.
                            Applications can also be downloaded from the Internet, some for free, and others you can buy using the internet.

                <p class="card-text text-lead text-primary text-capitalize">Python is an open source programming language made to both look good and be easy to read.
                    A programmer named Guido van Rossum made it in 1991. Python is named after the television
                    show Monty Python's Flying Circus. Many examples and tutorials include jokes from the show..</p>

                            Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run.
                            A program called an interpreter will run python code on any kind of computer it can run on itself.
                            This means if the programmer needs to change the code they can quickly see the results. This also means
                            Python is slower than a compiled language like C, because it is not running machine code directly.

                            Python has a very easy to read syntax. Some of it comes from C, because that is the language that
                            Python was written in. One big change with Python is the use of whitespace to delimit code: spaces
                            or tabs are used to organize code by the amount of spaces or tabs. This means at the end of each line,
                            a semicolon is not needed and curly braces ({}) are not used to group code, which are both common in C.
                            The combined effect makes Python a very easy to read language.
